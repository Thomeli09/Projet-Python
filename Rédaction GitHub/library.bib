	abstract = {This study aims at generating numerical 3D samples of concrete so as to study the effects of the granular inclusions shape on the macroscopic kinetics of reactive transport phenomena. Two types of mesostructure conﬁgurations are considered: the ﬁrst one is composed of a matrix of mortar in which are randomly distributed inclusions corresponding to the concrete coarse aggregates, and the second one also includes a steel rebar. The choice of a mesoscopic modeling for the mortar matrix is based on the need to obtain numerical structures of reasonable size. In particular, the Interfacial Transition Zones (ITZs) are assumed to be incorporated into the homogenized mortar properties. This study is applied to the case of drying and atmospheric carbonation by using simpliﬁed models solved by the ﬁnite element code Cast3M. The purpose is to quantify the inﬂuence of the aggregate shape on the kinetics of macroscopic transfer and the isovalue lines for some physical variables representative of the reactive transport problems: saturation degree for drying, and porosity, calcite and portlandite concentrations for carbonation. Basic aggregates shapes are studied (spheres, cubes), as well as more complex ones (Voronoi particles) which are supposed to be more representative of real aggregates. The effects of ‘non-isotropic’ shapes (oblate and prolate ones) are also investigated. It is shown that the inﬂuence of the aggregate shapes appears negligibly small on macroscopic indicators, except for oblate shapes with aspect ratios of 3. This latter case also exhibits substantial local delayed effects and a more important variability, which may have some importance for a precise description and estimation of degradation processes related to steel rebar corrosion.},

The second analysis is dealing with the interactions between mineral and vegetal oils applied on the wooden or steel formwork and fresh concrete.

The numerical results provided the movement of the carbonation front in time and species concentration inside the carbonated concrete, the validation of our results is made by comparing them with experimental testing in an accelerated carbonation chamber was promising. In this work we update the model to better approximate the experimental results by incorporating the diffusion of O2 and the variation of porosity in time, as the species generated by the carbonation reaction adhere to the pore walls. The decrease in pore size could affect the diffusion process to some degree, which will be modelled in this paper. The obtained results are encouraging for the next research activities.},

We developed an analytical solution for a corrected convection-dispersion model that takes into account the effects of dispersion on deposition kinetics with regard to the particle concentration decay type. The rationality and correctness of the solution were verified using time, distance, deposition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and decay coefficient. As the time increased, the particle concentration increased from zero to the peak value, then decreased to zero. However, as distance increased, the peak value of particle concentration gradually decreased. The deposition coefficient affected the magnitude of the peak value and the distance corresponding to the peak value. In addition, the greater the attenuation coefficient, the smaller the peak value. Overall, our method’s prediction results showed that considering the effect of dispersion on deposition kinetics produces better results than when this is not considered.},

	abstract = {This paper proposed a pore-scale model to simulate the eﬀect of initial soil density on the bimodal soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) of compacted soils. The pore-scale model is developed based on the bimodal poresize distribution. Soils with bimodal pore-size distribution is assumed to have dual porosity, namely the macropore structure and the micropore structure, and hypothesized that the micropore structure is hard to be compressed under mechanical loading. The water stored in the macropore structure is divided into two parts, the bulk water and the meniscus water, respectively. The deformation of soil (bulk water ﬂow) is obtained by horizontal shifting and vertical scaling of the pore-size distribution (PSD) function. A toroidal model is used to describe the inﬂuence of initial density on the meniscus water. The pore structure of compacted coal gangue was qualitatively imaged as an evidence of the pore structure changes, and the SWCC of the compacted coal gangue was quantitatively analyzed. Finally, a numerical method is advised for simulating bimodal permeability function by using the proposed model with Mualem function. Laboratory test results in published literature are employed to validate the proposed model and permeability function, and the model predictions showed good agreement with the experimental data in the literature.},

The Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) test method detects the presence of C–O in concrete samples as a basis for determining the presence of CaCO3. Concrete specimens were prepared and subjected to accelerated carbonation under conditions of 23 8C temperature, 70\% RH and 20\% concentration of CO2. The test results of TGA and XRDA indicate that there exist a sharp carbonation front. Three zones of carbonation were identified according to the degree of carbonation and pH in the pore solutions. The TGA, XRDA and FTIR results showed the depth of carbonation front is twice of that determined from phenolphthalein indicator.},

	abstract = {The reuse of industrial residue streams such as ﬂy ash (FA) or waste materials such as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) can be beneﬁcial both from an economic and an ecological point of view. Extensive research, investigating different properties of these concrete types, has been carried out so far. However, durability remains a key property ensuring sustainable application of these materials in the construction sector that still needs more research to be fully understood. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the application of widely used models for carbonation depth prediction—deﬁned for ordinary Portland cement concrete with natural aggregate (NAC)—to high volume FA concrete (HVFAC) and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). The research presented in this paper was conducted in two steps. First, an experimental programme was designed to provide better understanding of the inﬂuence of different CO2 concentrations on the carbonation process kinetics in HVFAC, RAC and NAC. This was performed using accelerated carbonation tests (CO2 concentrations of 1\%, 2\%, 4\% and 16\%) and natural carbonation tests (duration 21 and 48 months). Furthermore, a database of previously published results of HVFAC and NAC carbonation depths was made in order to analyse the application of carbonation depth prediction deﬁned by Tuutti and given in the ﬁb Model Code 2010. It was shown that the existing models, providing the relationship between accelerated test results and natural carbonation depth, are applicable to NAC and RAC but not to HVFAC. Modiﬁcations of the above mentioned models were proposed in order to enable a more accurate and reliable prediction of the HVFAC carbonation depth under natural exposure conditions.},

	abstract = {In reinforced concrete (RC) structures, carbonation induced corrosion is one of the most signiﬁcant durability issues. A very important factor that affects the carbonation process is the appearance of cracks in RC structures. According to the current state of the art, cracks have not yet been considered as a parameter in carbonation models which are used for deﬁning the service life of concrete structures. The main objective of this research is to analyse the inﬂuence of cracked concrete cover as reinforcement protection. The analysis was carried out using own experimental results and the application of available standards and novel predictions regarding carbonation depth. For that purpose, prismatic RC samples without cracks and with different crack widths (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.30 mm) were made and subjected to accelerated carbonation. The inﬂuence of carbonation depth on the corrosion of cracked and uncracked samples was analysed by observing the reduction of the reinforcement cross section. The compressive and tensile stress inﬂuence on carbonation resistance was also evaluated. The conducted analysis showed that even with low crack widths (0.05 mm) the maximum carbonation depth was signiﬁcantly higher compared with uncracked samples. It was also shown that reduction in the reinforcing bar cross section after 28 days of exposure to 2\% CO2 was between 0.05\% and 0.13\%, depending on the crack width. The results showed that compressive stress increase had no signiﬁcant effect in the carbonation depth of samples.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to study the impact of crushing and grinding on the porosity of hardened cement paste, which is responsible for the high values of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) water absorption. Hardened cement pastes with three different water to cement ratios have been crushed in one to three steps with a jaw crusher to produce aggregate larger than 2 mm and ground with a disc crusher in order to produce particles lower than 150 µm. Water absorption tests and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) were performed for the different resulting sizes. It was observed that the crushing procedure did not signiﬁcantly affect the porosity of the aggregate. However, MIP performed on the powders showed differences in the pore size distribution compared with the monolith. This can better be attributed to a modiﬁcation of the surface roughness of the particles than to a modiﬁcation of their porosity. In all cases, the water absorption rate was the highest during the ﬁrst 1 min after soaking in water. It was also observed that the morphology of the particles changed from a step of crushing to another.},

Our results suggest that water absorption of RCA at 24 h can be seen as the simple sum of the capillary absorption of both residual cement paste and initial natural aggregates. The absorption kinetics is similar to the capillary absorption of traditional uncrushed concretes but, on the industrial time scale of interest, is strongly affected by the size and conﬁguration of the residual cement paste patches at the surface of the initial natural aggregates. We ﬁnally propose a tentative frame for a classiﬁcation of RCA based on water absorption rate and water absorption capacity at 24 h.},

	abstract = {The carbonation mechanisms of concrete are analyzed in this paper, accounting for evolutions of relative humidity in the porous material. The model is based on macroscopic mass balance equations for the water, the carbon dioxide contained in the gaseous phase and the calcium contained in the pore solution, which are supposed to completely define the problem of atmospheric carbonation in concrete. These equations govern the diffusion and permeation processes of the three variables: saturation degree, carbon dioxide partial pressure and calcium concentration in pore solution. By using an idealized description of the main hydrated products of the cement paste, the dissolution phenomenon can be regarded as depending only on the calcium concentration in the aqueous phase. The calcite formation and the hydrates dissolution are introduced in the mass balance as source terms and conduct to significant variations of the porosity. The mass balance equations are discretized in time and space in the one-dimensional case. The simulation of a concrete wall subjected to combined drying and accelerated carbon dioxide attack is then performed, and the results are analyzed and compared with experimental data in terms of carbonation depth.},

	abstract = {This paper forms the first part of a series. In this first part, a broad range of normal and high-performance (HP) hardened cement pastes and concretes is studied under both laboratory and in-situ conditions. Water vapour desorption–adsorption experiments are carried out by means of the saturated salt solution method on very thin specimens. The effect of various parameters and in particular of the mix-composition is studied on the so-called water vapour sorption isotherms (WVSIs). It is found that the presence of aggregates does not influence the curves. Likewise, the peculiarities of HP materials are highlighted: within the high relative humidity (RH) range, significant lower water contents are measured than for normal materials, and large RH changes induce only slight variations of water content. More generally, desorption isotherms can be partitioned in several ranges, which are influenced or not by W/C: a unique partition is pointed out, valid for every material tested. Moreover, the hysteretic behaviour of the materials is investigated by plotting scanning isotherms within various RH ranges and by performing first and second desorption–adsorption cycles. Furthermore, a pore structure analysis is carried out from WVSIs. The bulk porosity accessible to water, the C–S–H ‘‘gel’’ porosity, the BET specific surface area, and the BJH pore size distribution are thus assessed, along with the C–S–H ‘‘gel’’ amount. In addition, a master curve is exhibited as regards the average adsorbed water layer thickness vs. RH, for RH ≤ 63.2\%.},

The durability assessment over the operational phase (supply 100 years) is decisive. In operating conditions, a ventilation system would maintain the CO2 partial pressure within the disposal, subjecting concrete to drying and carbonation. The temperature (due to the waste thermal output) and drying effects on carbonation have been studied in the past. The data acquired must however be complemented. In this sense, taking into account the water transfers simultaneously to carbonation is essential. On the one hand, because carbonation is a common pathology of reinforced concrete that leads to rebar corrosion. On the other hand, because the durability of reinforced concrete structures is dependent on their water content evolution all along their service life. The assessment of water transport properties in carbonated materials, under unsaturated conditions, is an important issue for Andra in charge of the management of radioactive waste in France.},

	abstract = {In aggressive environments, concrete itself may not be enough to protect the reinforcement against carbon dioxide penetration. This gas reacts with the portlandite of the concrete to form calcium carbonate. This process leads to a pH reduction and, therefore, promotes the depassivation of the steel reinforcement in reinforced concretes. Therefore, a supplementary protection method such as coating with a mortar, as carbonation barrier can be used to provide adequate durability. Experimental data are presented to illustrate the e ect of three di erent testing levels of CO2 on an industrial mortar applied to a concrete base in order to evaluate its performance as an anti-carbonation barrier. The results from the coated concrete are compared with the carbonation resistance of the uncoated plain concrete. The carbonation depth was determined using a phenolphthalein pH-indicator. A clear reduction in carbonation was observed when the mortar was applied. The validity of the accelerated testing method, which consists of placing the mortar in a high carbon dioxide concentration chamber for a controlled time, and carbonation coe cients to assess coating e ectiveness are discussed. The use of 100\% carbon dioxide is highly questionable for accelerated carbonation testing. c 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Chloride ingress and carbonation are the main factors leading to corrosion initiation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Lifetime assessment and maintenance optimization of these deteriorating structures has been based for several practical applications on analytical predictive models. The literature review shows that there are numerous analytical models of chloride ingress and carbonation. It was also found that comprehensive lifetime assessment requires that the selected models be able to propagate uncertainties in a correct manner. Thus, this paper proposes a methodology for probabilistic sensitivity analysis of analytical models for chloride ingress and carbonation. Given that diﬀerent parameter notations were found for each model, a homogenization of notations and generic forms are ﬁrst proposed. The sensitivity analysis is based on the following indicators: elasticity coeﬃcient, Pearson coeﬃcient, bias of the mean and standard deviation of the response of the model. The results highlighted which parameters are inﬂuential for each model by considering three concrete types. Overall results indicated a higher eﬀect of the nonlinearity of the models on the sensitivity indicators. It was found that the level of inﬂuence of each parameter depends also on the concrete type and the duration of the exposure to chlorides or carbon dioxide.},

Increasingly, municipal solid waste (MSW) land® ll operations refuse to accept C\&D waste. Skyrocketing tipping fees due to the scarcity of land® ll sites, and growing concerns from regulatory agencies and the public, have placed C\&D waste recycling operations under intense scrutiny. The experiences of regional C\&D recyclers indicate that successful recycling operations require a minimum of 0.8 ha of clear space for processing equipment, incoming waste stockpiles, recycled materials, and manoeuvring room for mobile equipment and operations. Reasonable quality, reliable equipment suitable for these operations generally costs between \$300 000 and \$750 000 for a 400± 500 tonne/day operation. At present, operators of these facilities make a pro® t almost solely on tipping fees, with the recycling operation functioning mainly to maintain materials throughput. Different categories of C\&D recycling machinery and waste processing strategies are presented. Strategies for converting C\&D land® lls into successful C\&D recycling operations are also examined. C\&D waste recycling economics are presented to demonstrate the essential ingredients for successful operations.},

While the bulk of the carbonation reaction is that of calcium hydroxide, other constituents of the porous matrix can also carbonate and compete with calcium hydroxide for carbon dioxide. Particularly the carbonation of calcium–silicate hydrates and unhydrated constituents are neglected by most authors in carbonation prediction models. In this paper, a mathematical model of carbonation is extended to include additional carbonation and hydration reactions. The competition of the several reactions and their effect on the carbonation depth is investigated by dimensional analysis and numerical simulations. A parameter study emphasises that multiple internal reaction layers appear. Their position and speed essentially depend on the strength of the different reactions. It is also observed that, for a wide range of parameters, the effect of some of the additional reactions on the carbonation depth is small. In particular, a comparison with data from laboratory experiments justiﬁes the neglect of the carbonation of the unhydrated constituents in prediction models.},

The results show that the modulus of elasticity, pulse velocity, and the long-term properties such as drying shrinkage and creep are significantly affected. It has been found that the detrimental effects of using crushed concrete fines in concrete can be mitigated by a partial replacement of crushed concrete fines with pulverised fuel ash (pfa).},

The water retention curve is an essential unsaturated soil function, which can be determined not only for soil samples, but also for other porous media. This study deals with the determination of water retention curve for different concrete mixtures that provide a substantial characteristic for the investigation and modelling of water flow through the pores of concrete. Our aim was to obtain the main characteristics of WRC for concrete and to investigate if there are significant differences between the WRCs of different concrete types. Hence, four different concrete mixtures that are commonly used in practice were examined. These concrete mixtures were made with two different cement quantities, two different water-cement ratios, with and without fibre reinforcement and with and without crystalline waterproofing admixture. The van Genuchten (1980) model, the original Fredlund and Xing (1994) model and a modified version, that showed consistency with the measured data, were used for curve fitting. The fitted curves were used to estimate the permeability function using van Genuchten (1980) and Fredlund et al. (1994) models.},

For both materials, carbonation process presents similarities. This work presents the background/implementation of an algorithm for a multi-physics simulation of the main fields associated with the carbonation process. This modelling was previously validated in literature. A 1D algorithm is implemented, using the Finite Difference Method. Its feasibility is demonstrated through the simulation of results presented in the literature. A parametric study is also shown considering the main parameters involved, important observation regarding the influence of the parameters on the carbonation depth are detailed.},

	abstract = {By crushing old concrete to make recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) for use in new concrete, the overall environmental impacts of concrete are reduced. However, a better understanding of the use of RCA in new concrete is necessary before adoption in structural concrete applications can be widely realized. In particular, the strength, stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity), workability, and durability of concrete using RCA can be different than concrete that uses natural aggregate (NA). Variability in RCA properties from source to source also must be addressed if guidelines for RCA use are to be adopted. This paper describes properties of RCA and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) with materials from four distinct areas of the United States (Northeast, South, Midwest and Southwest regions), making this study the most geographically varied study of RCA known. Variability in aggregate properties and the relationships between them are addressed within the paper. Equations allowing concrete mix designers to predict strength and stiffness of mixes are shown to be applicable across a much broader range of RCA properties than previously known. Similarly to concrete with natural aggregates, the strength and stiffness of RAC is shown to be impacted by the gradation of the coarse aggregates – smaller aggregates make stronger, stiffer concrete.

Two hybrid ensemble methods, the inverse variance method and the artificial neural network-based ensemble method, were proposed to integrate multiple algorithms. The models were trained on a dataset of 532 data points with 6 input variables. Performance evaluation metrics and the Taylor diagram were used to compare the models. The results showed that the hybrid ensemble models outperformed the single models, with the inverse variance-based model achieving the highest performance (R = 0.975, RMSE = 2.978 mm). Additionally, the contribution analysis indicated that carbonation time, CO2 concentration, and the amount of binder were the most influential factors. This study provides an efficient prediction model for carbonation depth and valuable insights for carbonation-resistant design in concrete structures.},

	abstract = {The retention (or release) of a liquid compound on a solid controls the mobility of many substances in the environment and has been quantiﬁed in terms of the ‘‘sorption isotherm’’. This paper does not review the diﬀerent sorption mechanisms. It presents the physical bases underlying the deﬁnition of a sorption isotherm, diﬀerent empirical or mechanistic models, and details several experimental methods to acquire a sorption isotherm. For appropriate measurements and interpretations of isotherm data, this review emphasizes 4 main points: (i) the adsorption (or desorption) isotherm does not provide automatically any information about the reactions involved in the sorption phenomenon. So, mechanistic interpretations must be carefully veriﬁed. (ii) Among studies, the range of reaction times is extremely wide and this can lead to misinterpretations regarding the irreversibility of the reaction: a pseudo-hysteresis of the release compared with the retention is often observed. The comparison between the mean characteristic time of the reaction and the mean residence time of the mobile phase in the natural system allows knowing if the studied retention/release phenomenon should be considered as an instantaneous reversible, almost irreversible phenomenon, or if reaction kinetics must be taken into account. (iii) When the concentration of the retained substance is low enough, the composition of the bulk solution remains constant and a single-species isotherm is often suﬃcient, although it remains strongly dependent on the background medium. At higher concentrations, sorption may be driven by the competition between several species that aﬀect the composition of the bulk solution. (iv) The measurement method has a great inﬂuence. Particularly, the background ionic medium, the solid/solution ratio and the use of ﬂow-through or closed reactor are of major importance. The chosen method should balance easy-to-use features and representativity of the studied natural conditions.},

The recycled concrete families were created by replacing parts of the natural aggregates forming families of concrete with 0\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 100\% of aggregates from recycled sources. The usual comparison between mixtures by comparison between behaviors of concrete families. This research shows that the mix design nomogram (MDN) is a new and useful tool that allows the researchers to compare properties and behaviors of different concretes. The results show that the family concrete with the highest pore volume and with the same compressive strength of 20, 30, and 40 MPa (2900, 4350, and 5800 psi) did not always correspond to the concrete family with the highest degree of carbonation. This experiment also showed that some compositional characteristics of concrete could have more influence on the durability that the traditional physical aspects.},

The apparent porosity and pore size distribution of the same concrete were determined through mercury intrusion porosimetry, performed on small-drilled cores. The normal-strength concrete mixes used in the experimental investigation were designed to exhibit a wide variation in their strengths. To ensure further variation in porosity, pore size distribution and strength, two modes of compaction, two varieties of coarse aggregates, different levels of age, curing period and exposure condition of concrete were also introduced in experimental scheme. With the data so generated, an appraisal of the most frequently referred relationships involving strength, porosity and pore size of cement-based materials was carried out. Finally, a new empirical model relating the in situ strength of concrete with porosity, pore size characteristics, cement content, aggregate type, exposure conditions, etc., is presented.},

Although the literature on sorption isotherms is rich, most of experiments and models employed are limited to systems that obey simple equilibrium isotherms, such as linear, favorable (convex-upward) or unfavorable (concave-upward). This paper deals with the rather overlooked Sshaped isotherms and their dimensionless forms, which are of great importance for the modeling of separation processes and interpretation of equilibrium data. A review on the physical signiﬁcance and applications of Sshaped isotherms in adsorption and ion exchange process is also presented.},

	abstract = {The use of normalized accelerated carbonation tests is currently limited to the classiﬁcation of concretes in terms of carbonation resistance and the results are not easily transposable to forecasting concrete carbonation in natural conditions. Common models assume that the kinetics of the carbonation front ingress in concrete is a square root function of the CO2 pressure but observations in the ﬁeld generally invalidate this assumption. Based on an experimental program including carbonation tests at several CO2 pressures, this paper shows that the amount of carbonated product depends largely on the CO2 pressure. Several experimental analyses of carbonated concrete under different pressures are confronted, to ﬁnally propose a new analytical model able to predict carbonation ingress in natural conditions using the results of accelerated tests. The model takes both the cement chemical composition and its amount in concrete into account. The carbonation kinetics dependence on CO2 pressure is considered through two underlying functions including, for the ﬁrst, the dependence of the CSH carbonation rate on the pressure and, for the second, the effect of this additional carbonation on the reduction of the CO2 diffusion coefﬁcient.},

The CO2 diffusion coefficients calculated on the basis of the distribution of carbonates are of the same order of magnitude as those measured by a direct method. A threshold value of diffusivity appears when the sand concentration increases. This point is discussed and compared with other characteristics of mortars and concretes that exhibit similar behavior.},

	abstract = {This study concerns the reuse and the valorization of raw waste materials. The main objective consists in the use of aggregates issued from the concrete for making a new manufactured one. In literature, many investigations have stated on the fact that the reuse of the sand (size {\textless} 5 mm) is more difficult than the reuse of gravels. Effectively most of pollutants are fine size particles thus they can be concentrated with the sand. Also the sands have a greater specific surface and so they need more water by absorption, what poses a problem at different levels of workability, for the resistance to 28 days and to the level of durability. In this study, we have decided to run tests on the resistance of mortars recycled to 100 \% aged of 28 days and a number of tests have been performed on cylindrical concrete samples with only reused gravel to 100 \%. Here the used aggregates are clean because waste are coming from samples tested in laboratory. That allows us to characterize the performances of concrete with reused aggregates without pollutants. Results are good, the fall of the resistance by recycling gravels does not exceed 11 \% for a fixed characteristic resistance of 26 MPa.
            Cette étude s’inscrit dans le cadre de la valorisation des déchets de chantier. L’objectif principal est l’emploi de granulats issus des bétons de démolition dans la fabrication de nouveaux bétons. Les études bibliographiques convergent sur le fait que le recyclage de sable (taille {\textless} 5 mm) est plus problématique que le recyclage de graviers. En effet du point de vue environnemental la plupart des polluants qui sont de taille très fine se concentrent dans les sables. Par ailleurs les grains de sable ont une surface spécifique plus grande et absorbent plus d’eau ; ceci pose des problèmes à différents stades de la fabrication et de la réalisation : affaissement, résistance à 28 jours et durabilité. Ainsi dans cette étude, nous avons décidé de mener des essais sur la résistance à l’âge de 28 jours de mortiers contenant des sables recyclés puis sur un certain nombre d’éprouvettes de béton avec du gravier recyclé uniquement à 100 \%. Les granulats utilisés ici sont des déchets de laboratoire, autrement dit des matériaux relativement propres. Cela permet de caractériser l’évolution des performances des bétons à base de granulats recyclés ≪ non pollués ≫. Les résultats sont encourageants, la chute de la résistance en recyclant le gravier uniquement ne dépasse pas 11 \% pour une résistance caractéristique visée de 26 MPa.},

CDW is usually randomly dumped or disposed in landﬁlls and the average recycling rate of CDW in China is only about 5\%. Considering there is big challenge in adoption of circular economy in CDW industry in China while related research is still limited, we conduct the CDW management analysis through 3R principle. Existing policies and management situations were investigated and analyzed based on the reduction, reuse and recycle principles. Results reveal that primary barriers of reducing CDW in China include lack of building design standard for reducing CDW, low cost for CDW disposal and inappropriate urban planning. Barriers to reuse CDW include lack of guidance for eﬀective CDW collection and sorting, lack of knowledge and standard for reused CDW, and an under-developed market for reused CDW. As for recycling of CDW, key challenges are identiﬁed as ineﬀective management system, immature recycling technology, under-developed market for recycled CDW products and immature recycling market operation. Proposals to improve the current situation based on 3R principle are also proposed, including designing eﬀective circular economy model, reinforcing the source control of CDW, adopting innovative technologies and market models, and implementing targeted economic incentives.},

	abstract = {Recycling of waste concrete has become an important issue worldwide due to the continued increase of construction wastes. Also, the growing global construction activities urge to ﬁnd sustainable resources to replace natural materials for the production of concrete. In the past few decades, many researches have been carried out on the use of recycled aggregate (RA) derived from construction and demolition wastes to produce concrete products. This paper reviews the previous ﬁndings on the effects of use of RA on durability of concrete. In general, the amount of adhered mortar and the quality of the original concrete have a signiﬁcant effect on the properties of resulting concrete. The increase of RA content and w/c ratio results in poorer durability of concrete. In comparison, the negative effect of recycled ﬁne aggregate is more obvious than that of recycled coarse aggregate. The use of pozzolanic materials either for surface coating of RA or intermixed within the concrete are effective and feasible to improve the overall durability of concrete. Recent researches on CO2 treatment indicate that it can enhance the properties of RA and durability of concrete signiﬁcantly.},

	abstract = {The heat island effect and the high use of fossil fuels in large city centers are well documented, but by how much fossil fuel consumption is elevating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and whether elevations in both atmospheric CO2 and air temperature from rural to urban areas are consistently different from year to year are less well known. Our aim was to record atmospheric CO2 concentrations, air temperature and other environmental variables in an urban area and compare it to suburban and rural sites to see if urban sites are experiencing climates expected globally in the future with climate change. A transect was established from Baltimore city center (Urban site), to the outer suburbs of Baltimore (suburban site) and out to an organic farm (rural site). At each site a weather station was set-up to monitor environmental variables for 5 years. Atmospheric CO2 was consistently and signiﬁcantly increased on average by 66 ppm from the rural to the urban site over the 5 years of the study. Air temperature was also consistently and signiﬁcantly higher at the urban site (14.8 1C) compared to the suburban (13.6 1C) and rural (12.7 1C) sites. Relative humidity was not different between sites whereas the vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) was signiﬁcantly higher at the urban site compared to the suburban and rural sites. An increase in nitrogen deposition at the rural site of 0.6\% and 1.0\% compared to the suburban and urban sites was small enough not to affect soil nitrogen content. Dense urban areas with large populations and high vehicular trafﬁc have signiﬁcantly different microclimates compared to outlying suburban and rural areas. The increases in atmospheric CO2 and air temperature are similar to changes predicted in the short term with global climate change, therefore providing an environment suitable for studying future effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Soil-water characteristic curves (SWCCs) are routinely used for the estimation of unsaturated soil property functions (e.g., permeability functions, water storage functions, shear strength functions, and thermal property functions). This paper examines the possibility of using the SWCC for the estimation of in situ soil suction. The paper focuses on the limitations of estimating soil suctions from the SWCC and also suggests a context under which soil suction estimations should be used. The potential range of estimated suction values is known to be large because of hysteresis between drying and wetting SWCCs. For this, and other reasons, the estimation of in situ suctions from the SWCC has been discouraged. However, a framework is suggested in this paper for estimating the median value for in situ soil suction along with a likely range of soil suction values (i.e., maximum and minimum values). The percentage error in the estimation of soil suction from the SWCC is shown to be lowest for sand soils and highest for clay soils.},

These solutions adjust the atmospheric humidity to the specific deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) of the salt. Practical problems like the risk of spilling or ‘creeping’ of salts can be overcome. The DRH of suitable salts does not depend significantly on temperature. Solutions were Oddy-tested to check for corrosive emissions of the acids corresponding to the salt anions. Only magnesium chloride failed in accordance with thermodynamic calculations of the HCl vapour pressure. Solutions can absorb water-soluble pollutants like acids or aldehydes from the atmosphere, as has successfully been demonstrated for formaldehyde in chamber experiments. The alkaline potassium carbonate solution not only dissolves acids and aldehydes but also reacts with them chemically. Research needs to further study the absorption of pollutants are outlined. A revival of the saturated salt solution would make museum displays more sustainable.},

The metastable phase-aragonite is formed only to a small extent. The formation of vaterite mainly depends on a relatively lower CO2 concentration (1, 10\%) and on a moderate relative humidity (50, 75\%); the opposite holds true for its rapid transformation into calcite (30\% CO2, r.h. = 100\%). As a consequence of pseudomorphosis, no substantial change occurs in the outer forms of the 11 Å-tobermorite crystals, even though complete decomposition has taken place. It was also proved that the pressure strength values of porous concrete test cubes maximally decreased by 10\% after two years depositing when compared with the data before carbonizing. Zusammenfassung Durch die Karbonisierung von 11 Å-Tobermorit und CSH-Gel entsteht neben SiO2-Gel zuerst Vaterit, das in die stabile Modifikation: Calcit übergeht. In einem geringen Ausmass kommt es zur Entstehung einer weiteren metasbabilen Phase - Aragonit. Die Bildung von Vaterit ist hauptsächlich durch eine relativ niedrigere CO2-Konzentration (1, 10\%) und durch eine mittlere relativ Feuchte (50, 75\%) bedingt; entgegensesetzt ist es bei den Bedingungen seiner schnellen Umwandlung in Calcit (30\% CO2, r.F. = 100\%). Infolge einer Pseudomorphose werden die äusseren Formen der 11 Å-Tobermoritkristalle nicht wesentlicher verändert, wenn auch es zu einer vollkommenen Zersetzung von Tobermorit gekommn ist.

The approach is based on random tessellations constructed from random inclusion packings. A general methodology to obtain arbitrary-shaped tessellations to produce disordered foams is presented and illustrated. These tessellations can degenerate either in classical Voronoï tessellations potentially additively weighted depending on properties of the initial inclusion packing used, or in Laguerre tessellations through a simple modiﬁcation of the formulation. A versatile approach to control the particular morphology of the obtained foam is introduced. Speciﬁc local features such as concave triangular Plateau borders and non-constant thickness heterogeneous coatings can be built from the tessellation in a straightforward way and are tuned by a small set of parameters with a clear morphological interpretation.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes have evolved considerably in the past years, growing into a wide range of products through the use of different materials depending on its application sectors. Nevertheless, the fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique has proven to be an economically feasible process turning additive manufacture technologies from consumer production into a mainstream manufacturing technique. Current advances in the ﬁnite element method (FEM) and the computer-aided engineering (CAE) technology are unable to study three-dimensional (3D) printed models, since the ﬁnal result is highly dependent on processing and environment parameters. Because of that, an in-depth understanding of the printed geometrical mesostructure is needed to extend FEM applications. This study aims to generate a homogeneous structural element that accurately represents the behavior of FDM-processed materials, by means of a representative volume element (RVE). The homogenization summarizes the main mechanical characteristics of the actual 3D printed structure, opening new analysis and optimization procedures. Moreover, the linear RVE results can be used to further analyze the in-deep behavior of the FDM unit cell. Therefore, industries could perform a feasible engineering analysis of the ﬁnal printed elements, allowing the FDM technology to become a mainstream, low-cost manufacturing process in the near future.},

	abstract = {The representative volume element (RVE) plays a central role in the mechanics and physics of random heterogeneous materials with a view to predicting their eﬀective properties. A quantitative deﬁnition of its size is proposed in this work. A RVE size can be associated with a given precision of the estimation of the wanted overall property and the number of realizations of a given volume V of microstructure that one is able to consider. It is shown to depend on the investigated morphological or physical property, the contrast in the properties of the constituents, and their volume fractions. The methodology is applied to a speciﬁc random microstructure, namely a two-phase three-dimensional Vorono€ı mosaic. Finite element simulations of volumes of diﬀerent sizes are performed in the case of linear elasticity and thermal conductivity. The volumes are subjected to homogeneous strain, stress or periodic boundary conditions. The eﬀective properties can be determined for large volumes and a small number of realizations. Conversely, smaller volumes can be used providing that a suﬃcient number of realizations are considered. A bias in the estimation of the eﬀective properties is observed for too small volumes for all types of boundary conditions. The variance of computed apparent properties for each volume size is used to deﬁne the precision of the estimation. The key-notion of integral range is introduced to relate this error estimation and the deﬁnition of the RVE size. For given wanted precision and number of realizations, one is able to provide a minimal volume size for the computation of eﬀective properties. The results can also be used to predict the minimal number of realizations that must be considered for a given volume size in order to estimate the eﬀective property for a given precision. The RVE sizes found for elastic and thermal properties, but also for a geometrical property like volume fraction, are compared.},

This mindset has long dictated the research priorities surrounding the developments towards low‐emission binders. By reviewing documented practical experience and scientific literature, we show that this widely held view is too simplistic. There are many cases from engineering practice where carbonation of the cementitious matrix surrounding the steel did not lead to noticeable corrosion or related damage at the level of a structure. The influencing factors that can, however, lead to considerable corrosion damage are identified as the moisture state, the microstructure of the carbonated concrete, various species that may be present – even in minor amounts – in the concrete pore solution, and the cover depth.},

In this study, we attempted to use iron oxide red to distinguish these two kinds of mortars in carbonated concrete with recycled aggregate from laboratories and demolished buildings respectively. First, the inﬂuence of iron oxide red on the strength and carbonation depth values of the mortar, and on its micro-structure were investigated. Additionally, the properties of new mortar and old mortar coloured by iron oxide red in recycled aggregate concrete under carbonation were studied. The results showed that adding iron oxide red did not affect the strength values, carbonation depth values, and corresponding micro-structure of the mortar. Moreover, iron oxide red can clearly distinguish the new mortar and old mortar in carbonated concrete with recycled aggregate from laboratories and demolished buildings respectively. The properties of these two kinds of mortars showed some differences. Therefore, further research should give more attention to the effect of the distinctions based on sampling location on the experimental results, such as the complete carbonation zone and semi-carbonation zone widths.},

Among the most important factors that can greatly affect carbonation resistance of concrete are relative humidity (RH) and water cement ratio. This paper investigates the effect of variation of RH on carbonation resistance of concrete made with different cementitious materials; CEMI42.5N, CEMIII/ A42.5N, and CEMIII/A42.5N with 10\% silica fume as an addition. Compressive strength and accelerated carbonation test were conducted on different concrete mixes. The relation between carbonation depth and RH had been analyzed, based on most common carbonation models; model code-FIB, Chinese codes model and Jiang et al. s-model. The results indicated that relation between RH and depth of carbonation is a polynomial function within certain range which agrees with the Chinese code. This ﬁnding is crucial for accurately predicting the carbonation behavior of concrete structure using different models.},

In addition, this phenomenon generates additional repair costs, which can sometimes exceed the initial cost of the building. Furthermore, it depends on the type and class of cement, two main classes of cement are used for the formulation of concrete in Algeria, ordinary Portland cements and cements with additions.},

Hardened concretes prepared by using different water-to-cement ratios in the laboratory, were crushed to produce recycled aggregates with different particle sizes. Before and after the laboratory carbonation process, the physical properties of the recycled aggregate, including water absorption and density were determined. The extent of CO2 curing of the recycled aggregate was quantiﬁed by assessing the carbonation percentage of the aggregates. Carbonation resulted in reduction in water absorption values and increase in density and these showed that the properties of recycled aggregate were improved. The factors inﬂuencing the CO2 curing process, including curing time, particle size and moisture contents of the recycled aggregate, were investigated. Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Numerical results are obtained and compared with experimental results. The degree of carbonation, temperature, gaseous pressure, moisture content and saturation of water within the material are predicted and presented. The inﬂuence of material saturation, temperature and pressure of supercritical CO2 on carbonation depth is investigated through parametric studies.

Compared with the existing models, the proposed model can predict more accurate carbonation depths. For RAC specimens, compared with the ﬁb model and Xiao and Lei's model-a, the COV of model error of the proposed model is 0.36 which is decreased by 33.3\%, and when compared with Xiao and Lei's model-b and Silva et al.’s model, the corresponding decreases are 55.2\% and 16.2\%.

The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closedform analytical expressions for the relative hydraulic conductivity, Kr, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expressions for Kr(h) contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil-water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-form analytical expressions based on the Mualem theory are compared with observed hydraulic conductivity data for five soils with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil-water retention curve at low water contents is important for an accurate prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.},

	abstract = {Carbonation is one of the critical issues affecting the durability of reinforced concrete. Evaluating the depth of concrete carbonation is of great signiﬁcance for ensuring the quality and safety of construction projects. In recent years, various prediction algorithms have been developed for evaluating concrete carbonation depth. This article provides a detailed overview of the existing prediction models for concrete carbonation depth. According to the data processing methods used in the model, the existing prediction models can be divided into mathematical curve models and machine learning models. The machine learning models can be further divided into the following categories: artiﬁcial neural network model, decision tree model, support vector machine model, and combined models. The basic idea of the mathematical curve model is to directly establish the relationship between the carbonation depth and age of concrete by using certain function curves. The advantage of the mathematical curve model is that only a small amount of experimental data is needed for curve ﬁtting, which is very convenient for engineering applications. The limitation of the curve model is that it can only consider the inﬂuence of some factors on the carbonation depth of concrete, and the prediction accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The advantage of using the machine learning model to predict the carbonation depth of concrete is that many factors can be considered at the same time. When there are sufﬁcient experimental data, the trained machine learning model can give more accurate prediction results than the mathematical curve model. The main defect of the machine learning model is that it needs a lot of experimental data as training samples, so it is not as convenient as the mathematical curve model in engineering applications. A future research direction may be to combine a machine learning model with a mathematical curve model to evaluate the carbonation depth of concrete more accurately.},

	abstract = {Humans are continuing to add vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning and other activities. A large fraction of the CO2 is taken up by the oceans in a process that lowers ocean pH and carbonate mineral saturation state. This effect has potentially serious consequences for marine life, which are, however, difﬁcult to predict. One approach to address the issue is to study the geologic record, which may provide clues about what the future holds for ocean chemistry and marine organisms. This article reviews basic controls on ocean carbonate chemistry on different timescales and examines past ocean chemistry changes and ocean acidiﬁcation events during various geologic eras. The results allow evaluation of the current anthropogenic perturbation in the context of Earth’s history. It appears that the ocean acidiﬁcation event that humans are expected to cause is unprecedented in the geologic past, for which sufﬁciently well-preserved records are available.},

	abstract = {The use of recycled aggregates obtained from the processing of construction and demolition waste has been applied increasingly. The usual alternative for recycling crushed concrete from building demolition is as granular sub-base layers in road pavements and drainage, but more recently recycled aggregates have been used as aggregate in concrete. There are many researches and reports about the fresh and hardened properties of concrete made with recycled concrete aggregate, but there is insufficient knowledge about the durability of this concrete. This paper discusses the performance of concretes with recycled concrete aggregate submitted to carbonation. Concrete with different strengths (18, 37 and 50MPa) were produced, in laboratory, crushed and as recycled aggregates were used in different mixture proportions (25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%) in a 32.5MPa concrete. After cure and humidity equalization, they were submitted to accelerated carbonation (chamber with 1\% CO2 and 70\% RH). Results indicate that higher amounts of recycled concrete aggregates increase the carbonation depth, when using recycled concrete aggregates from concrete with lower strength than the new concrete, but recycled concrete aggregates from concretes with higher strength do not result in lower durability due to carbonation.},

	abstract = {The cement paste in concrete and mortar has been shown to have a pore size distribution different than that of plain paste hydrated without aggregate. For mortar and concrete, additional porosity occurs in pore sizes larger than the plain paste's threshold diameter as measured by mercury intrusion. Based on the assumption that these larger pores are essentially present only in the interfacial zones surrounding each aggregate, an experimental program was designed in which the volume fraction of sand in a mortar was varied in a systematic fashion and the resultant pore system probed using mercury intrusion porosimetry. The intrusion characteristics were observed to change drastically at a critical sand content. Similar results are observed for a series of mortar specimens in which the cement paste contains 10\% silica fume. To better interpret the experimental results, a hard core/soft shell computer model has been developed to examine the percolation characteristics of these interfacial zone pores. Using the model, interfacial zone percolation in concretes is also examined. Finally, the implications of interfacial zone percolation for transport properties and durability of mortar and concrete are discussed.},

              Blended cements, where Portland cement clinker is partially replaced by supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), provide the most feasible route for reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with concrete production. However, lowering the clinker content can lead to an increasing risk of neutralisation of the concrete pore solution and potential reinforcement corrosion due to carbonation. carbonation of concrete with SCMs differs from carbonation of concrete solely based on Portland cement (PC). This is a consequence of the differences in the hydrate phase assemblage and pore solution chemistry, as well as the pore structure and transport properties, when varying the binder composition, age and curing conditions of the concretes. The carbonation mechanism and kinetics also depend on the saturation degree of the concrete and CO

	abstract = {Carbonation depth-profiles have been determined by thermogravimetric analysis and by gammadensitometry after accelerated carbonation tests on ordinary Portland cement (OPC) pastes and concretes. These methods support the idea that carbonation does not exhibit a sharp reaction front. From analytical modelling, this feature is explained by the fact that the kinetics of the chemical reactions become the rate-controlling processes, rather than the diffusion of CO2. Furthermore, conclusions are drawn as to the mechanism by which carbonation of Ca(OH)2 and C–S–H takes place. Carbonation gives rise to almost complete disappearance of C–S–H gel, while Ca(OH)2 remains in appreciable amount. This may be associated with the CaCO3 precipitation, forming a dense coating around partially reacted Ca(OH)2 crystals. The way in which CO2 is fixed in carbonated samples is studied. The results indicate that CO2 is chemically bound as CaCO3, which precipitates in various forms, namely: stable, metastable, and amorphous. It seems that the thermal stability of the produced CaCO3 is lower when the carbonation level is high. It is also shown that the poorly crystallized and thermally unstable forms of CaCO3 are preferentially associated with C–S–H carbonation.},

	abstract = {Carbonation processes cannot be ignored as regards durability and service-life of new concrete structures, and their correct understanding and quantiﬁcation are essential for maintenance and repair works on existing structures. This paper initially presents a new meta-model developed to calculate carbonation front depth based on the analytic solution of Fick’s ﬁrst law. The only input data required by this non numerical model are: (i) material variables (concrete mix design, maximum nominal aggregate size, cement type, and chemical composition of cement type CEM I and cement density); (ii) technological parameters (initial curing period (tc)); (iii) environmental parameters (ambient temperature (T), relative external humidity (RH) and CO2 concentration in the air ([CO2]ext)). Consequently, this model is fully suitable for the prediction of carbonation depth in the case of new reinforced concrete structures, for which these required parameters are well-known. The meta-model is validated using data from the literature on short and long-term natural carbonation exposure conditions. Most of the experimental data concern CEM I, CEM II, CEM III cement types, and CEM I additives (ﬂy ash (FA)) with various water to cement (W/C) ratios and tc. The meta-model is also compared with two already available models: Papadakis’ model and Yang’s model. The three model predictions are compared with the corresponding values found in the literature. The results conﬁrm that the prediction of the new meta-model proposed here for estimation of carbonation depth is the most accurate in every case.},

	abstract = {Ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) is an environmental stressor that can lead to the carbonation and deterioration of RC structures. In the present paper a useful model to predict carbonation depths is reviewed. The model uses CO2 concentration as an input parameter, but there appears to be a lack of quantitative data on existing CO2 concentrations in typical urban or industrial cities. Hence, the paper reports on CO2 concentrations collected from the city of Brno in the Czech Republic. It was found that the ambient CO2 concentration attributable to a typical urban environment is approximately 5-10 \% higher than CO2 concentrations in a rural environment. Carbonation depths were calculated for RC structures with service lives of up to 100 years. It was seen that the increase in urban and global CO2 concentrations have little influence on these predicted carbonation depths. Using a minimum (worldwide rural) CO2 concentration of 370 ppmv for exterior exposures and assuming that material and environmental properties are known, will provide a lower bound on the actual depth of carbonation. Finally, a probabilistic analysis showed that variability in carbonation depths can he high due to uncertainty and variability of environmental and material properties.},

	abstract = {Durability and recycling are two major concerns in the construction industry. Concrete carbonation may impair reinforced concrete durability as it favors the onset of reinforcement corrosion. The use of recycled aggregates, as a replacement for natural aggregates, in construction applications is a feasible way of recycling given materials from construction and demolition waste. The aim of this study is to quantify the contribution of potential conditioning factors to the carbonation rate of concrete incorporating recycled aggregates. For this purpose, a multiple linear regression technique was used, considering the mix design characteristics, environmental conditions, and recycled aggregates’ properties as explanatory variables, capable of predicting the coefficient of carbonation. The investigation was founded on ample experimental data, collated from several studies. This study proposes a general model, in which the carbonation in concrete depends on the 28-day compressive strength, clinker content, environment’s CO2 content, and aggregates’ equivalent water absorption. The models are statistically significant, with determination coefficients suggesting high correlation between the coefficients of accelerated carbonation of concrete in the experimental data and values predicted by the proposed models.

	abstract = {Damage of reinforced concrete structures is often caused by corrosion of steel reinforcements due to carbonation. Although literature on carbonation has become vast, a comprehensive numerical model for quantitative prediction of the corrosion risk that allows for environmental influences such as temperature and humidity seems lacking. The aim of the present paper is the development of a theoretical model to predict carbonation of concrete structures. The model describes movement and retention of heat, moisture and carbon dioxide (CO2) by means of balance equations and diffusion laws. The balance equations are coupled and take into account the interaction between different transport and storing processes. A new mathematical formulation of the function of moisture in balance faithfully represents the moisture-storing properties of a porous media. The evolutionary equation of the reaction of CO2 is derived from reaction kinetics that are described by the Arrhenius’ function. The model is solved by means of an efficient numerical method using a Finite Element concept and numerical time integration techniques. It is verified by using results from experimental tests reported in the literature. Taking into account changing atmospheric conditions, structures are investigated with respect to the corrosion risk of steel reinforcements. Together with threshold values taken from the literature, the numerical results give the corrosion risk of reinforced concrete structures. D 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As time passes the properties of concrete change as a result of its interaction with the environment and durability is affected. Reinforcement corrosion is singled out in various studies as being mainly responsible for reinforced concrete degradation. Concrete alkalinity protects the reinforcement bars from corrosion but the carbonation phenomenon signiﬁcantly contributes to the destruction of their passive coating, thus favouring the corrosion onset. Therefore, concrete carbonation is considered an important problem both in Civil Engineering and in Materials Science. This study’s main objective is to try to quantify the contribution of potential conditioning factors to concrete carbonation’s rate. This study addresses the statistical modelling of the concrete carbonation phenomenon, using a large number of results (964 case studies), collected in the literature. A computational method (multiple linear regression analysis) is used to deﬁne a mathematical model that can estimate the carbonation coefﬁcient as a function of a set of conditioning factors. These models allow the estimation of the carbonation coefﬁcient, and consequently the carbonation as a function of the variables considered statistically signiﬁcant in explaining this phenomenon. Two distinct models are proposed to suit predictions to two environmental exposure relative humidity ranges.},

The sea water contains abundant contents of ion species including chlorides, and the carbon dioxide exists in the air, which could be exclusively high under industrial-polluted condition.

During this process, the mechanism of synergetic work of carbon dioxide, chloride ions and moisture are investigated in the present study. The carbonation process impacts the chloride transport by debounding, while the pore structure will also change, so that the transport characters vary for both. The effects of crucial environmental parameters, the temperature, the relative humidity and the carbon dioxide concentration, on the interaction of carbonation and chloride transport process, are also scrutinized. Considering the existence of liquid in the pore phase, this work principally examined the influence of unsaturated environment on the binary ingress process of chloride and carbonation.},

	abstract = {Soil–water characteristic curve (SWCC) is the most fundamental and important soil property in unsaturated soil mechanics. It has been used for analyzing slope stability due to the inﬁltration of rainfall into slopes and water ﬂow in unsaturated embankments. Generally, SWCC is obtained by laboratory tests. However high cost, long duration and difﬁculty of the tests impede the application of unsaturated soil mechanics to practical design or analysis. Therefore, several equations have been developed to predict the SWCC using grain-size distribution (GSD) curve. However, most of the equations were limited to soils with unimodal characteristics and the parameters of the equations are not related to the physical properties of the soil. In this paper, an equation to predict SWCC for soils with bimodal characteristics is proposed. The parameters of the proposed equation are related to the physical properties of soil and the variables of SWCC closely. The proposed equation is evaluated with data from the literature and laboratory tests carried out in this study. In addition, the computer codes for the computation of the predicted bimodal SWCC are presented.},

A statistical analysis on the effect of introducing increasing amounts of recycled aggregates on the carbonation depth and coefﬁcient of accelerated carbonation is presented. This paper also presents the use of existing methodologies to estimate the required accelerated carbonation resistance of a reinforced recycled aggregate concrete exposed to natural carbonation conditions with the use of accelerated carbonation tests. Results show clear increasing carbonation depths with increasing replacement levels when recycled aggregate concrete mixes are made with a similar mix design to that of the control natural aggregate concrete.

The final aim is to develop and test a practical method for determining the durability characteristics of existing buildings liable to carbonation, as well as estimating the corrosion initiation time of a building at the design stage. Two industrial sheds with different ages and located in different areas have been analyzed performing both experimental tests and numerical analyses. Finally, a case of carbonation-induced failure in a prestressed r.c. beam is presented.},

Therefore, it is necessary to understand their distribution between the phases. According to Henry’s law, the equilibrium ratio between the abundances in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase is constant for a dilute solution. Henry’s law constants of trace gases of potential importance in environmental chemistry have been collected and converted into a uniform format. The compilation contains 46 434 values of Henry’s law constants for 10 173 species, collected from 995 references. It is also available on the internet at https://www.henrys-law. org (last access: October 2023). This article is a living review that supersedes the now obsolete publication by Sander (2015).},

	abstract = {Gas permeability is an important property associated with the durability of cement-based materials. In this study, an experimental method based on applying a quasi-stationary flow is adopted to evaluate the gas permeability of cement-based materials. The results indicate that the intrinsic permeability of dried cement-based materials is affected by the addition of limestone powder, fly ash, and aggregate. The Katz-Thompson equation could predict the intrinsic permeability by using the capillary porosity, average diameter, and pore tortuosity. The intrinsic permeability of partially saturated cement-based materials decreases when the water saturation increases. The Van Genuchten-Mualem model could describe the relative gas permeability of partially saturated cement-based materials, and the model parameters n value between 1 and 2 while m value ranging from 0.64 to 0.69 for cement and mortar. Moreover, the power function relationship between the intrinsic permeability and Klinkenberg constant of cement-based materials has also been corroborated. Finally, a prediction model of gas permeability of cement-based materials under arbitrary water saturation and pressure gradient is proposed.},
